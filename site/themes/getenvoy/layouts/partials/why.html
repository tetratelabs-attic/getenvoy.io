        <h3>Why GetEnvoy</h3>
        <p>Envoy is a great edge and service proxy and with its rich set of L7 features, its a great candidate for use for north-south as well as east-west communications.
           But unfortunately, as with a lot of open source projects, there is a lack of consistent tooling. This makes it difficult to build, deploy and maintain a fleet of Envoy instances easily. 
           The goal of the GetEnvoy project is to work with the Envoy community to address these issues and make Envoy adoption easier. 
           Weâ€™re working with end-users, vendors and cloud providers to build tooling that provides general solutions to Envoy lifecycle problems that can be leveraged by the wider community.</p>
